## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the School of Global Public Health  at [New York University](https://publichealth.nyu.edu/).  I  received a Ph.D in Industrial Engineering with concentration on Statistics 2024 from Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. [Yajun Mei](https://sites.gatech.edu/yajun-mei/) and Prof. [Jianjun Shi](https://sites.gatech.edu/jianjun-shi/). Before that, I received my B.S. in Statistics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2019, advised by Prof. Zemin Zheng. 

**I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market and would be happy to discuss any opportunities!**



## Research Interests

I am interested in developing statistical methodology and theory in machine learning and statistics for streaming data, particularly in active/reinforcement/transfer learning and change-point problems, and their application in Engineering and Biomedical Science.
